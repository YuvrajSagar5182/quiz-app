# Quiz App

This project is a Quiz App built using React. It allows users to answer a series of quiz questions and provides feedback on their answers. The app is created using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) framework.

**Note:** This project is primarily intended as a practice exercise for honing my skills in React and solidifying my understanding of fundamental concepts.
